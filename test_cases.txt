=== Future Tests ====

1. Consider what happens when you enter an incorrect email in forgotten password Test
2. check social links work
3. load Testing
4. API testing for user profile data etc
5. Finish forgot password loop
6. Accessibility testing - plugins - https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-accessibility-checker
7 Usability tests for process flows etc


=== Considerations from assigment ===

1. Not released to production so URL's probably be different and would have to set up environment alongside these tests
2. Not best practice to include password and sensitive information in these files, for ease i have left them in but this is not how i would handle this data, i would probably place the files in git ignore and enable each user who pulls these tests scripts to creaste their own json file with their own senstive data...
3. Some tests could be more granular
4. Tests interacting with the back end of the project would also be beneficial
