# Automation_task_v2

I have created an automation framework to test different log in scenarios on the hudl.com website. 
I have used Cypress as that is what I am most comfortable with, it enabled me to explore different scenarios further.
To note: I am using a MacBook pro currently running macOS Monterey, version 12.6.5

Future developments: to test in different environments such as windows or linux
